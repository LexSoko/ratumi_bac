ABSTRACT
n this thesis two adsorbates are studied using Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy: Pentacenequinone and 2-Hydrogen-Phthalocyanine which
fall into this category and are extensivly researched. The primary
objective of this thesis is to comprehend and classify the adsorption characteristics
of those two molecules on Ag(100), and for 2HPc also on ultrathin MgO(100) layers
grown on Ag(100).
