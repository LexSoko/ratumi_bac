### ABSTRACT 
```
Since the development of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) in 1981 it was
used to get an insight into the electronic structure of molecules.  Especially the
adsorption of organic molecules on metal or metal-oxide substrates peaked inter-
est in the STM-Imaging field because of their semiconducting properties and their
capacity for self-assembly. Additionally they promise cheap, flexible and tunable al-
ternatives to conventional inorganic semiconducters in electronic and optoelectronic
engineering fields [14]. In this thesis two adsorbates are studied using Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy: Pentacenequinone and 2-Hydrogen-Phthalocyanine which
fall into this category and are extensivly researched. The primary
objective of this thesis is to comprehend and classify the adsorption characteristics
of those two molecules on Ag(100), and for 2HPc also on ultrathin MgO(100) layers
grown on Ag(100).
