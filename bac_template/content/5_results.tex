\section{2-Hydrogen Phthalocyanin on Ag(100)}
\label{sec:results}The STM and LEED Images of 2-Hydrogen Phthalocyanin (2HPc) on Ag (100) show the Formation of an ordered Structure.
As seen in the Image \ref{fig:2hpcAg_o} the 2HPc  is most likely in $\sqrt{17} \times  \sqrt{17}\text{R}14$ Phase with an relative rotation of the molecular axis (MA) in respect to the [011] direction of 7 ° (see Fig XXX). 
Furthermore the STM Images reveal that the distance between the nearest molecules is 
15 A and that the unit cell of the monolayer is also square.

\noindent The Molecule itself appears as a 4-fold symmetric cross with a dark center in the middle or as 2-fold symmteric cross with two opposing isoindole units seeming brighter than the other two for positive polarity . 
It oriented so that the benezene ring of one 2HPc molucule is pointed towards the benzene ring of the nearest neighbor. 
For negative biasvoltages (filled state imaging), near the fermi level a two fold symmetric orbital is seen.

\noindent This is most likely due to charge transfer from the metal substrate , leading to an occupied LUMO and thus a charged molecule.  
There are two degenerated LUMOs (same Energy), with the probability density concentrated around two opposing isoindole units. 
This makes the Molecule reduce its symmetry from 4-fold to 2-fold.
One difference of the two degenerated LUMOs is the orientation of the probability density, as it is rotated 90° in respect to eachother.
The STM images (see Fig.\ref{fig:LUMO_1}) reveal a connection beween two opposing isoindole units, which is in agreement  with the simulated orbitals using density functional theory (DFT).  
There is no favored orientation seen in the STM images, it is seemingly random which suggest that the occupation probability of the two LUMOs is the same. 
Its worth mentioning that the LUMO is also visible for positive bias which suggest two things: the negativly charged molecules LUMO is singly or fractionaly occupied and therefore it is possible for a electron to tunnel into that state or it tunnels into the other not occupied LUMO. The latter is suported by the
