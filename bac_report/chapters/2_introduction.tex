\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:anmerkung}
Since the development of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) in 1981 it was used to get an Insight in to electronic structure of molecules and individual atoms in crystals.
Especially the adsorbtion of organic molecules on metal or metal-oxide substrates peaked interest in the STM-Imaging Field in recent years.
The reason why there is a lot of interest in studying these organic adsorbents is their promissing semiconducting properties and their capacity for self-assembly.
Additionally they promise cheap, flexible and tunable alternatives to conventional metal-semiconducters in electronic and optoelectronic \cite{OTERO2017105}.
